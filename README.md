## Setting up your DeepAI API Key

This project uses the DeepAI Photo Editor API for image enhancement. To use this feature, you must provide your own DeepAI API key.

### Steps:
1. **Create a free DeepAI account:**
   - Go to [DeepAI Sign Up](https://deepai.org/signup) and create an account.
2. **Get your API key:**
   - After logging in, visit your [API Keys page](https://deepai.org/dashboard/profile) to copy your key.
3. **Add your API key to the project:**
   - In the project root, create a file named `.env` (if it doesn't exist).
   - Add the following line to `.env`:
     
     ```env
     VITE_DEEPAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
     ```
   - Replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual DeepAI API key.
4. **Restart the development server** if it's running, so the new environment variable is loaded.

**Note:** The `.env` file is ignored by git and will not be committed to the repository.
