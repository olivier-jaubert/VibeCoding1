This project is a modern web gallery built with Vite + React. It is designed to display images from a local folder in a visually appealing, responsive format.

## Features
- Fast, modern React-based UI
- Responsive gallery layout
- Click any photo to view it larger in a modal
- Easy to add or remove images from the `src/assets` folder

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Adding Your Photos
- Place your `.jpg` images in the `src/assets` folder (subfolders are supported, but `annex` is reserved for artist info).
- The gallery will automatically display all images in this folder.
